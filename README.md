# Tic_Tac_Toe
Created a tic tac toe game in python using a gui/ visual style to it using the Pygame module.

Included a CLI version of the game that was one of the first projects everdone in Python.

Added an executable so it can be used by windows users without python installed using pyinstaller.

*Note* make sure you have Pygame installed before running the game on your computer before running the game through Python by using: `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
Simply run the game from the CLI or double click the tic.py (Windows users only).
